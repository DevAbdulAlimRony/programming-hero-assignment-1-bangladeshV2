       <p>"I strongly believe that we can create a poverty-free world, if we want to... In that kind of world, the only place you can see poverty is in the museum. When school children will be on a tour of the poverty museum, they will be horrified to see the misery and indignity of human beings. They will blame their forefathers for tolerating this inhuman condition to continue in a massive way."</p>
